# sample-site-python
 My first attempt learning how to build a website using Django (Python) framework, HTML and CSS
 
Why Django framework
 - Python web framework 
   - Most used language due to my data science career path
   - Also a lot more versatile and an industry standard in comparison to Flask, Cherry Pie, Web2py and Pyramid
 - Server Side framework 
   - I want to focus more on backend development
 - MVT designer pattern
   - I wanted an easy and fast to deploy designer pattern
