# sample-site-python
 My first attempt learning how to build a website using Django (Python) framework, HTML and CSS
 
## Why Django framework
 - Python web framework 
   - Most used language due to my data science career path
   - Also a lot more versatile and an industry standard in comparison to Flask, Cherry Pie, Web2py and Pyramid
 - Server Side framework 
   - I want to focus more on backend development
 - MVT designer pattern
   - I wanted an easy and fast to deploy designer pattern

## What I learned:
### Frontend
- Transforming HTML structures into aesthetically pleasing designs.
- Learning CSS best practices to make webpages for optimal user experience.
- Making dynamic and interactive pages using Jinja
### Backend
- implementing multiple connected apps in Django with their own CRUD methods
  - includes modelling relationships and using signals to update the dependent models
- Building a relational database in Django
- Create a user authentication system using Django's User models
- Allow a reviewing and messaging system
- building REST APIs
- production and deployment of a local website
